Data wrangling concepts covered in this project:

1. Gathering
    Read data available on the local environment
    Read data from a webpage using python requests
    Read data from the twitter API using tweepy
    
2. Assess the three dataframes for any data quality or data tidiness issues

3. Clean the issues found in (2) above (if any).


PS: The resulting clean data will be used to build predictive models.
